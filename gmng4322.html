        <h1>GMNG 4322 - Game Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Modeling</h1>
        <p>Undergraduate course, Texas A&M University-Victoria, Computer Science Department, 2023</p>
        <p>This course covers a range of topics in artificial intelligence, including heuristic search, minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, and strategy game playing. It also delves into semantic networks, propositional and predicate logic, modal logic, expert systems, machine learning, neural networks, artificial life, learning through emergent behavior, genetic algorithms, intelligent agents, natural language understanding, and machine vision.</p>
        <h2>Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to understand heuristic search and how minimax search is applied in games. They will be able to generate and implement their own AI project ideas in a game context. Additionally, students will develop the skills to work and communicate effectively in a team setting.</p>
