        <h1>COSC 4320 - Software Engineering</h1>
        <p>Undergraduate course, Texas A&M University-Victoria, Computer Science Department, 2023</p>
        <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will understand the distinction between functional and non-functional requirements, as well as user and system requirements, and be able to write a Software Requirements Specification document using requirements engineering processes. </p>
        
        <p>They will implement design methods such as object-oriented (OO) design and Unified Modeling Language (UML), and work with various software life-cycle models, including the waterfall model, V model, rapid prototyping model, incremental model, and spiral model. Students will learn to generate and deliver a software product based on their own project ideas, fostering creativity and innovation. </p>
        
        <p>The course emphasizes the development of teamwork and communication skills, preparing students to work effectively in collaborative environments. Additionally, students will gain a solid understanding of software engineering ethics, ensuring they are aware of the professional and ethical responsibilities in the field of software development.</p>
