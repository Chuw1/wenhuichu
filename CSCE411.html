        <h1>CSCE 411  – Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>
        <p>Undergraduate/Graduate course, Texas A&amp;M University, Computer Science and Engineering Department</p>

        <p>
            Credits: 3. 3 Lecture Hours.  
            Design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on techniques for developing efficient solutions and proving correctness and complexity. Topics include asymptotic analysis, recursion and divide-and-conquer, greedy methods, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Students will learn to select appropriate algorithmic paradigms, reason formally about correctness, and analyze time and space complexity. The course also introduces fundamental lower-bound arguments and the limits of efficient computation through intractability results.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prerequisite: Discrete mathematics and data structures background (e.g., CSCE 222 and CSCE 221 or equivalents).
